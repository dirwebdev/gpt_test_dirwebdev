# dirwebdev Repository

Welcome to my `dirwebdev` GitHub repository! This is a special repository where I'm learning Git with the guidance of ChatGPT, my virtual instructor.

In this journey, ChatGPT is teaching me the ins and outs of Git and GitHub, making this experience both informative and enjoyable. A big shoutout to ChatGPT for this incredible tutorial!

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to explore the world of version control with Git.
